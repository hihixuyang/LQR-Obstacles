Lines 20-27 give some descriptions of the key values to tweak in the simulator.

There are some improvements that could be made to the base of the code such as splitting some of the functions into their own files and organizing. This version of the simulator was built off of one from Dr. van den Berg and then modified as necessary. Being my first major code undertaking in school there are some definite improvements that could be done.

More importantly than the code improvements, one major improvement that needs to be done before real work begins on this is a better convex hull implementation. At the time of making this simulator I was having some trouble getting hte Boost library implemented which includes a nice Convex Hull functionality. In place of that we opted to use the qhull.exe environment but there was a major problem in that we couldn't get it implemented as a C++ library and only run is as an executable. Therefore, to run convex hull the program currentlyw rites the points to a txt file and the qhull.exe takes those in and outputs the convex hull indeces as a file, which are read back into this cpp. That is a major bottleneck and the file writing was not included in the timing results for the paper. I had hoped to come back and fix this, but we had an idea for a next paper and somewhat mvoed on. I did get boost implemented in a newer simulator for another project so I could potentially help with this phase moving forward.
